metagene-maker
==============

Makes metagene plots for bedgraphs over given regions. Useful in analysis of ChIRP-seq, ChIP-seq, GRO-seq, and other NGS datasets.

Simple start
----------

1. Clone project to new directory
2. Make config file (see below)
3. Run: `metagene_maker.py <config file>`, either in `screen` or `nohup`
4. Output: excel spreadsheets for each region in a new `averages` folder in the user-provided parent directory

Dependencies
--------

Base Python (>2.7) and R (>3.0)

At least 4 GB RAM if your largest bedgraphbedgraph is 1 GB and you use 4 cores (empirical rule: n cores * m GB bedgraph --> mn GB RAM needed)

Known bugs
--------

Still doesn't work too well for stranded bedgraphs (i.e. GRO-seq data). Implementation is in progress.

Configuration file
--------

### Parameters
**name:** the name appended to all output files

**parentDir:** the folder where all output subfolders will be located (see below for directory structure)

**organism:** either hg19 or mm9 depending on organism

**threads:** number of processors used

### Bedgraph columns
**folder:** the name of the sample (should also be the name of the folder where sample-specific intermediate files will be made)

**bedGraphLoc:** absolute path to bedgraph

**stranded:** + if plus only, - if minus only, 0 if no strand information

### Region columns
**regionType:** name of region

**fileLoc:** absolute path to file specifying the regions of interest

**header:** y if header, n if no header

**chrCol:** 0-indexed column number of chromosome designations

**nameCol:** 0-indexed column number of name designations

**startCol:** 0-indexed column number of start designations

**stopCol:** 0-indexed column number of stop designations

**stranded:** y if directional (i.e. TSS's), n if not directional (i.e. enhancers)

**strandCol:** 0-indexed column number of strand designations; put 0 if no strand

**numCols:** number of columns in file

**limitSize:** y if only regions >200bp and <200kb should be considered; n if no limitation

**numBins:** number of bins. anywhere between 100 and 1000 is good

**extendRegion:** y if regions in the bed file should be extended 1x upstream and downstream; n otherwise

Directory structure
------

### Parent directory
the directory specified in the configuration file; contains all files generated by this pipeline

### Subfolders

**averages**: contains one file for each region type; each file is an Excel spreadsheet with graphable metagenes for each sample

**\<sample\>**: a folder for each sample, named as described in the config file; contains intermediate files described below

### Contents of each sample folder

**bedGraphByChr:** bedgraphs split by chromosome

**bins:** in this folder, there are subfolders for each region type, containing profiles for each instance of the region, intermediate RData files, and metagene plots
